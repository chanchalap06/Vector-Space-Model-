Note
As of August 10, 2015, Google is a subsidiary of the Alphabet Inc.
What helps Google stand out from its competition, helps it continue to grow, and be the number one search engine is its PageRank technique that sorts search results. While being one of the best search engines on the Internet, Google also incorporates many of its other services, like Google Maps and Google Local, to provide more relevant search results.
