The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.

The aerial event, first held in 1964, lauds itself as “the world’s fastest motor sport,” with participants flying at speeds that can exceed 500 mph.

Back in 2011, a World War II-era plane participating in the event crashed near the grandstand, killing the pilot, 10 people on the ground and injuring scores more. That crash was blamed on aged plane components, high speed and undocumented and untested modifications that had been made to the aircraft.
